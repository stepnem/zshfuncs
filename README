This is my collection of functions for Zsh <http://zsh.sf.net>.

Some of them might be of general interest:

_clbuild: Completion for clbuild <http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/>.
_git: Upstream Git completion with some updates/additions and corrections.
_hg: Same as Git, but for Mercurial.

Comments or improvements welcome.
